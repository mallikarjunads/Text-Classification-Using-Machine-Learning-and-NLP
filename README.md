# Text-Classification-Using-Machine-Learning-and-NLP
This project focuses on text classification using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning. The goal is to classify textual data into predefined categories such as Education, E-commerce, Technology, Healthcare, Entertainment, Finance, News, Travel, Sports, and Other. The project applies data preprocessing, feature extraction, and various machine learning models to achieve high accuracy in classification.

Objectives:-

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Utilize spaCy for tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization to clean the text.
Feature Engineering: Use TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to transform text data into numerical features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Generate a word cloud, bar plots, and pie charts to visualize word frequency and category distribution.
Model Training & Evaluation: Train multiple models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, Na√Øve Bayes, XGBoost) and evaluate them using cross-validation.
Performance Comparison: Identify the best-performing model based on accuracy scores.

Technologies Used :-

Python for scripting and implementation
spaCy for text preprocessing
Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation
Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization
Scikit-learn & XGBoost for machine learning models
TF-IDF Vectorization for feature extraction

Key Outcomes:-

Efficient Text Processing: Enhanced text processing using spaCy's lemmatization and stopword filtering.
Insightful Data Visualization: WordCloud and bar plots highlight common words, while pie charts show category distribution.
Best Model Selection: Cross-validation helps identify the most effective model for accurate classification.
